Nevertheless, citizens could submit requests to the municipality to open a register. Here are some additional indications, depending on the situation.Planning and development\u00a0- For draft by-laws under the Act respecting land use planning and development, the municipality may not proceed with the registration of qualified voters and the referendum process during a health emergency. However, qualified voters may submit applications for referendums. These applications may be forwarded to the municipality individually, rather than by petition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public notice announcing that provisions are subject to referendum approval could invite qualified voters to transmit their requests in this way.\u00a0 If it receives a sufficient number of requests, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of council members, whether the project is a priority.\u00a0 For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation identical to the one planned as an alternative to public consultation meetings. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. If it has already held such a written consultation to replace the meeting provided for in the Act, it does not have to repeat it and the regulatory adoption process continues. If such a consultation has not previously taken place, the procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The minist\u00e8re des Affaires municipales et de l\u2019Habitation recommends that this public notice \u00a0 \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address at which the proposed regulation or resolution is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15\u00a0days following publication of the notice.For non-priority projects, the municipality suspends the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.\u00a0 If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality). Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws. During a health emergency, the Minister of Health and Social Services has the power to order the construction of any work or the installation of facilities for health purposes or the provision of health and social services. To do so, the minister is not required to comply with the regulations in force.Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and creation of financial reserves For these projects, the municipality cannot undertake a registration process for qualified voters and referendum voting during a health emergency. As is normally the case, qualified voters cannot apply for these types of projects. However, in order to determine the applicable procedure, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of the members of council, whether the project is a priority. For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. The procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The minist\u00e8re des Affaires municipales et de l\u2019Habitation recommends that this public notice\u00a0 \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. \t\t\u00a0For projects deemed to be non-priority, the municipality will suspend the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.\u00a0 For all borrowing by-laws, regardless of the applicable procedure (priority project or project exempted from the referendum approval process), the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve them, as is normally the case.Municipal territorial organization\u00a0\u2013 The Act respecting \u00a0municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of referendum approval processes in certain situations (municipal groupings, name change, change of regime, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality, etc.).\u00a0 However, this process occurs only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date stipulated by the latter. During a health emergency, if such a referendum process were to be ordered, it would not be held until the health emergency is lifted. The process would therefore be suspended until further notice.",

The Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian governments are taking various measures to minimize the impact of the pandemic on each individual\u2019s financial situation. The\u00a0Child Support Payments Calculation Tool\u00a0\u00a0is available to help you estimate child support payments you must make or will receive based on your individual situation. The interactive form costs nothing to use, and is simple and quick to complete.\u00a0Simply enter your data, and the calculation will be carried out automatically. Before adjusting the amount of child support payable, if you\u2019ve lost your job, for instance, it would be best to know the amounts to which you will be entitled in order to determine your income.\u00a0 The child support payment amount can also include costs related to children, for example daycare costs. Since parents will not have to cover these costs during the pandemic whether or not they are entitled to emergency daycare services, they may be taken into account when reviewing the support payable, but only for the period during which these fees are waived.\u00a0 Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services. Parents\u2019 contributions will be covered by the Minist\u00e8re de la Famille. Parents who can no longer use educational childcare services during the public health emergency will no longer have to pay childcare costs. For more information, visit the\u00a0Minist\u00e8re de la Famille\u2019s website\u00a0",

In the context of an HAS application, the creditor who receives last resort assistance must send a support application notice at least 10 days before submitting the agreement. All proceedings before the Superior Court instituted by a party who receives last resort assistance to cancel, reduce or suspend support payments must be notified to the Attorney General of Qu\u00e9bec.
